Information:
1) There is a Rowa Simulator Folder. No need to edit the folder. It is used as a listener to connect with the StockDeliverySimulator.

2) Within the StockDeliverySimulator, you need to edit the solution.

3) Edit the solution to be like what it is expected in the output video.

Requirements:
- Basically, there are 3 requirements

#1: Remove all features that is not needed. Only one tab remains: that is the Stock Deliveries tab. Notice that all other tabs are gone.

#2: For the Stock Deliveries tab, create a button that can load an csv file of stock deliveries with the columns as indicated in the sample input folder.

I.e. It should load the csv file and populate in the stockdeliverysimulator

#3 Upon loading the simulator, when "Send" button is pressed at the bottom right corner, it will be able to fire a stock delivery message (after connecting to the listener rowa simulator) as shown in the video.

- The successful message will be shown as seen in the log of the video.
